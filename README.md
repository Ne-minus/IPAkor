# Korean IPA automatic transcription
Our transcription is based on rules. You can see them in the way generative phonology would prescribe them below.

We believe the transcription to represent the South Korean standard language.

## The rules

### Position rules
ʧ → t/_\#, ʧʧ → t/_\#, ʧʰ → t/_\#

h → t/_\#, s → t/_\#, ss → t/_\#

h → ɦ/ V_V

### Assimilation
k → kʰ/h_, t → tʰ/h_, p → pʰ/h_

k → kʰ/_h, t → tʰ/_h, p → pʰ/_h

t → s/_s

n → l/_l, n → l/l_, t → l/_l

p, pʰ, pp → m/_m; p, pʰ, pp → m/_n 

t, tʰ, tt → n/_m; t, tʰ, tt → n/_n 

k, kʰ, kk → ŋ/_m; k, kʰ, kk → ŋ/_n

(And we use different phonemes)

## Challenges

### Palatalization
...

### Voicing
...

### We ignored the following things:
1. Words like 지하철역, 알약, 십육 which have ethymological ㄹ in place of written ㅇ, are read as if they don't have ethymological ㄹ.
2. Originally Chinese words that do not have voicing (like 길가) do have it in our transcription.

If you have a list of words of either group, feel free to share with us.
